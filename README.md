## Description

Project backend, because I was bored to start every project from kind of scratch, and copy modules from other projects
Then I came with idea to bring them together and publish it here as open source projects.

Projects is based on framework [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## License

  Nest is [MIT licensed](LICENSE).


## TODO

First stage:

* auth (jwt)
    * login
    * register
    * verify
    * password reset
    * password remind
    * notifications
    
Next stages:
    to be continued 
    
## Notes

I will try to wrote all of the components as independent modules with [CQRS](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/cqrs)
